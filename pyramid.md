# The Contributor Pyramid

![illustration of a contributor pyramid](/contributor pyramid.png)

Any healthy, well-staffed open source project with more than a couple dozen participants can be described as a Contributor Pyramid.  This model looks at the amount of involvement people have with the project from least (bottom) to full-time commitment (top), as well as their authority and responsibility.  

The reason we use a pyramid instead of a ladder is to remind ourselves that lower levels have many more people in them.  In terms of contributor recrutiment and development, it take dozens to hundreds of users to produce one new maintainer.  If we were looking at it by the volume of contributions, it would be an inverted pyramid, as for most projects the maintainers are responsible for the majority of total contributions.

This makes this model useful for developing our strategy around evolving the project. As you proceed with your open source project you are looking to build out a healthy, robust, growing or at least stable pyramid.  This model defines the structure of the rest of this book; each of the sections can be thought of in terms of which level of the pyramid you're working on.

Let's start by explaining the levels of this pyramid from bottom to top:

**Silent Users**: these are the people and organizations who use your project, but do not have any contact with the project community other than downloading software.  Often they use the project as a dependency of some other piece of software.  Others may be enthusiastic about the software, but unaware or unwilling to make contact.  For popular software, these are the vast majority of users, but until they become Involved Users their identity is unknown and their existence strictly statistical.

**Involved Users**: some minority of your users can become involved with the project.  This includes participating in community forums, attending meetups and conferences, filing and commenting on bug reports, filling out surveys, or interacting with contributors in social media.  They may mention your project in articles, videos, and on social media. These are the users that you know about.

**New/Occasional Contributors**: These are users who have just made their first contribution to the project, and users who contribute infrequently. Often they are people who are contributing "in their spare time" and don't really think of themselves as members of the project.  Others may only contribute in a very specific, narrow area of the project that suits their interests or skills. The difference between an Involved User and an Occasional Contributor is their activities in helping others in the project.  For example, someone who reports their own bug is an Involved User, but someone who works with the testing team for weeks to develop a test to detect that bug is an Occasional Contributor.

**Regular Contributors**: Contributors who contribute frequently, but do not hold any position of authority in the project.  These contributors make comments, submit minor fixes, and offer input in community decisions regularly but not in any great volume.  They do not usually attempt any large or complicated changes, but may volunteer for low-intensity regular responsibilities (like forum moderation or issue triage).

**Reviewers**: Also known as Subproject Owners, Plugin Maintainers, Team Leads, and many other roles, all medium-to-large projects have defined roles with authority which are below Project Maintainers.  Sometimes this means being the owner of some specific, narrowly-scoped piece of the project (e.g. Security Response Team member), and sometimes it means having the ability to review contributions but not merge them, or only merge them in very specific areas. Basically, if someone is a Regular Contributor with a named role and responsibilities they are probably a Reviewer.  Additionally, Regular Contributors who frequently spend time reviewing and mentoring other contributors are Reviewers as well.

**Maintainers**: the Maintainers are the people who "own" the project.  Their decisions on approving changes are final, and they usually have the authority to make decisions around branding, resources, promotion and demotion of contributors, and scope.  In general, Maintainers are also personally responsible for a majority of project contributions; it's not uncommon for the Maintainers of a project to author 70-90% of new lines of code.  For a newly founded project, the Maintainers may be the only contributors. In large, complex projects with multiple leadership councils the list of maintainers can be harder to define.  Most maintainers will have jobs that support their work on the project.

None of these populations are static.  Constantly, almost every person in your project is either increasing or decreasing involvement.  When monitoring your project, you need to look at movement up and down the pyramid.  That tells you if your project is growing or shrinking. While individual cases can vary a lot, in general it's useful to look at contributors as moving between levels one at a time.
