## Defining Your Users

Before you can reach your users, you need to figure out who your users are.

Some lucky folks will be reading this part for a project which already has a bunch of users and can simply get them to fill out a survey (but see the Surveys section).  Most project owners will be trying to create that user base from zero, though, which means figuring out who your potential users are.

This sounds very difficult, but fortunately it's well-trodden ground by the folks in Marketing.  They call it "defining your target audience" and the principles are the same whether you're talking about open source users or factory customers.

You can start by asking the following questions:

1. What problem does my project solve or capability does it add?
2. Who has that problem or that need?
3. Of those people, who is in a position to adopt your project?

For example, if your project was a network monitoring tool, you might have something like this, with even more detail:

1. Project allows scalable collection of network events across a large cluster without sacrificing detail.
2. Network administrators and network security staff who are responsible for large clusters and would like more clarity on exactly what's happening on their networks, plus vendors who make tools for those staff.
3. Staff who work at startups and very OSS-friendly companies, particularly new cloud stack companies.  Open source vendors who sell to those markets.

Once you've identified the types of users and their needs, you can move to creating a few personas of your "typical" users.  This is where you make up a story around who those users are and how they would use your project.  If you have the time and resources to actually do some interviews, you can ground these personas in the experiences of real users, but even if you need to completely make up a story it's still valuable.

A persona story walks through who the user is, how they do their jobs, what their needs are (in relation to your project), and how they would adopt and use your project.  Based on the hypothetical network monitoring project, here's an example:

Terry is a network administrator for ...

After you figure out how they would use your software, you need to figure out what the best ways to reach those personas would be.  What publications do they read?  What events do they go to?  Do they prefer blog posts or videos?  Do they use Slack, or prefer email?  Again, some actual user research in the form of surveys or engaging industry analysts can help you here, but if you lack resources you can rely on the familiarity that your existing contributors already have with your target users.

While this kind of exercise may seem artificial, it's absolutely necessary for you to make a plan around building awareness.  You're not going to make the entire planet aware of your project; even if you wanted to, you couldn't afford it.  Instead, you need to target likely prospective users, reaching them on the channels they use, addressing their needs and problems, participating in the events they go to.

Also, in the process of writing these persona stories you're going to find some gaps in your project functionality, documentation, or deployment.  That gives you a very useful list of things to fix.

Over the life of your project, this target user profile and personas will change.  As your project grows you will be able to add new use-cases and new groups of users.  Folks will also show up with uses for your software that you didn't anticipate, and you'll need to redefine.  But at least you have someplace to start.
