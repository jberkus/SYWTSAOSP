# Why are you doing this?

Before we get started with the lifecycle of your open source project, we need to figure out why you have one at all.  Or *whether* you have one.

Setting your goals in establishing an open source project is the key to making the rest of your journey successful.  It lets you decide which parts of the open source process are for you -- and which aren't.  If you don't have well-defined high-level goals for your project, there is no way to achieve success with it since there is no definition of success.  And you'll spend a lot of time arguing with your collaborators.

One way to define these goals is to ask yourself, your team, and your organization: "What does success with this project look like?"

## Consulting With Your Stakeholders

In most cases, it's not just your goals that matter.  It's the goals of your group, which can include your immediate team, your department, your organization, and for some projects partners, customers, users, and even open source collaborators.  For that reason defining the what requires defining the who.
